narendramodi,2019-05-14,"Seeing how his party colleagues are abusing me turn by turn, one Congress leader started feeling left out. No wonder, he has reiterated the ‘Modi is Neech’ diatribe. We always knew Congress is anti-backward. People will give a strong answer to the Congress."
narendramodi,2019-05-14,"Coming back to Chandigarh is about several memories and familiar faces. After today’s rally, I met Madan Ji, who was an integral part of the BJP office when I lived here.

narendramodi,2019-05-13,Punjab’s Congress Government has been a dismal failure. Add to that the arrogance and anti-Sikh mindset of the Congress High Command. No wonder Akali Dal-BJP is Punjab’s choice. Sharing photos from Bathinda.

narendramodi,2019-05-12,"Touched by the response in Indore and Khandwa. Congress, which has two and a half Chief Ministers in Madhya Pradesh, is headed for a big defeat. The only industry thriving under Congress in MP is the transfer posting industry. People see BJP as their ray of hope."

narendramodi,2019-05-11,"Never expect a Mahamilawat Government to bother about the security apparatus of the nation. The last time a Third Front Government was in power, where SP was an integral part, they weakened our intelligence operations and India suffered greatly due to it."

narendramodi,2019-05-11,The patriotism and farsightedness of Atal Ji and his team have a major role to play in the success of tests of 1998.

The hard work of our scientists has always ensured a stronger and safer India. May we continue leveraging the power of technology for national progress.

narendramodi,2019-05-09,"During the UPA era there were Commonwealth Games. In our tenure Kumbh took place in Prayagraj. Both were great opportunities to showcase India at the world stage. While the Kumbh is admired universally, CWG Scam brought shame and was an insult to our athletes."

narendramodi,2019-05-09,"Neither the Congress and Communists, nor TMC have shown any respect to the ideals of Gurudev Tagore. These are inherently anti-democratic parties who would never want minds without fear and heads held high. BJP will build the Bengal of Gurudev’s dreams."
narendramodi,2019-05-09,"Didi, Instead of getting angry at me please address the angers of: The poor whose money TMC has looted. Youngsters whose dreams you haven’t fulfilled. Government employees who are underpaid thanks to your obstinate nature. Citizens who can’t pray with dignity in Bengal."
narendramodi,2019-05-09,"BJP won’t allow TMC to impose their culture of thuggery, loot, bullying and nepotism on West Bengal."
narendramodi,2019-05-09,"She abuses me daily. Her party harasses innocent people and loots them. Under pressure from her, her administration didn’t cooperate on flood relief. They even deny rally permissions. Who is She? And how will she react after seeing these photos from Bankura and Purulia?"
narendramodi,2019-05-09,Azamgarh is going to elect a BJP MP. Watch my speech.

narendramodi,2019-05-09,"Gurudev Tagore manifests the best of India’s ethos of learning and expressing. A multifaceted personality, his prose, poetry and artwork are brilliant and thought-provoking. He enhanced India’s pride and richly contributed to the freedom movement. Tributes to him on his Jayanti."

narendramodi,2019-05-09,"In Haryana and Delhi, the message of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' is clearly resonating among people. Congress and other parties have only indulged in divisive and destructive politics. Here are highlights from yesterday's rallies."
narendramodi,2019-05-09,"Delhi is known for its welcoming nature. People from all regions and religions live in harmony. This is the spirit of brotherhood that makes Delhi special. Sadly, Congress trampled over this ethos of Delhi by its conduct in 1984. Such a communal party can’t ever govern India."

narendramodi,2019-05-06,"My one comment on the corruption of a former PM has riled the Congress eco-system so much but constant, below the belt remarks on a sitting PM, his family, his poverty have no effect on them! Constant badmouthing of historical greats by one Dynasty doesn't affect them either!"
narendramodi,2019-05-06,"My open challenge to Congress. Fight elections in the name of the former PM associated with Bofors in: Delhi and Punjab, where innocent Sikhs were butchered in his reign. Bhopal, where he helped Warren Anderson flee after the infamous Gas Tragedy. Challenge accepted?"
narendramodi,2019-05-06,"Spectacular sights from Chaibasa. True to its style, Congress is relying on a corrupt dynasty to win this seat. Sadly for them, people are going to reject Congress. Spoke extensively about NDA government's efforts for tribal welfare. @BJP4Jharkhand"
narendramodi,2019-05-06,"Seamless co-ordination between the Centre and Odisha Government augured well in the run up to Cyclone Fani and in helping affected citizens. Leveraging technology and human skills, work towards strengthening Odisha’s infrastructure will continue at a record pace."

narendramodi,2019-05-05,"Inconsistent figures, incorrect facts and incomprehensible narratives…this is the Congress way."
narendramodi,2019-05-04,Here is how the people of Bihar showed their support at Ramnagar. Bihar does not need lanterns because the NDA Government has worked extensively to brighten people’s lives and transform the state. Bihar also does not need hands that loot the state.
narendramodi,2019-05-04,"In 2013-2014 price rise was among the top issues. That is because Congress and price rise are a strong team. During the last five years, prices of basic commodities have been kept under check so that people are not burdened."
narendramodi,2019-05-04,"India has been a victim of terrorism for decades but in the last five years, our stand on the issue has received far-reaching global support. The results are for everyone to see."

narendramodi,2019-05-03,"Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Jamnagar to Silchar…you would enjoy reading this article on the extent and diversity of my travels over the last 125 days, and how they give me strength to serve 130 crore Indians. http://nm-4.com/rgn8"

narendramodi,2019-05-01,Congress’ corruption and nepotism has ruined Rajasthan. The state is backing BJP! Watch from Jaipur.
narendramodi,2019-05-01,"Campaigned in Kaushambi and Ambedkar Nagar in Uttar Pradesh. SP has done great disservice to Dr. Lohia's ideals and BSP has abandoned the principles of Dr. Ambedkar. BJP is devoting all possible resources to serve the poor and downtrodden. That is why, people trust BJP."

narendramodi,2019-04-30,"It is always a delight to be in Bihar. In Muzaffarpur, elaborated on the NDA's development agenda and the vision for the coming years. It is clear that the state is backing the BJP, JD(U) and LJP."
narendramodi,2019-04-30,"This election, the fundamental questions facing UP are: Do SP, BSP and Congress have any plan to eliminate terror? Can SP, BSP and Congress look beyond their own families? Do we want a Mahamilawat Government that does not work and causes elections frequently?"
narendramodi,2019-04-30,The campaign continues with exceptional vigour! Have a look at pictures from Bahraich and Barabanki. Opposition parties aren’t even contesting enough seats to get the Leader of the Opposition post and they are dreaming to be PM and Ministers!
narendramodi,2019-04-30,Bihar's vote is with NDA. Watch from Muzaffarpur.
narendramodi,2019-04-30,"Looking forward to campaigning in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh today. Will address rallies in Muzaffarpur, Bahraich and Barabanki today. Watch these rallies live on NaMo TV or the NaMo App."
narendramodi,2019-04-30,"Eastern India is strongly supporting NDA! Previous governments ignored this region for decades. Now, the fruits of development are reaching people. West Bengal’s anger with TMC is visible all over! Here are highlights from rallies in Jharkhand and Bengal."
narendramodi,2019-04-29,"Here are pictures from the campaigns in Barrackpore and Srerampur. When I attend a rally in Bengal, I feel that particular rally is the biggest. But then, the next one is always bigger! BJP rallies in Bengal manifest courage and respect for democracy. Time of TMC goons is up!"
narendramodi,2019-04-29,"Priceless moments from the rally in Barrackpore, which Didi will not like to see. Come 23rd May, TMC will be comprehensively rejected by the people of West Bengal."
narendramodi,2019-04-29,"Didi wishes to send me Rasgullas made of the soil and stones of West Bengal. Didi, it would be my honour to have such Rasgullas, that have the taste of such a great and brave land."
narendramodi,2019-04-29,Spoke to officials regarding the situation arising due to Cyclone Fani. Asked them to take preventive measures and be prepared to provide all possible assistance. Also urged them to work closely with Governments of the affected states. Praying for everyone's safety and wellbeing.
narendramodi,2019-04-29,Another phase of the General Elections begins today. I hope those voting today do so in large numbers and break the voting records of the previous three phases. A special appeal to young voters to head to the polling booth and exercise their franchise.
narendramodi,2019-04-28,What struck me about @iamsunnydeol is his humility and deep passion for a better India. Happy to have met him today. We are all rooting for his victory in Gurdaspur! We both agree.
narendramodi,2019-04-27,"Yesterday began with programmes in the cultural nerve centre of India, Kashi. I addressed BJP workers and filed my nomination papers. This was followed by rallies in MP. Final rally of the day was in the financial powerhouse of Mumbai."
narendramodi,2019-04-27,"Dear Mumbaikars, A vote for NDA is a vote for more development and zero corruption. It is a vote for a stronger nation and a stable Government. NDA is the only alliance that can effectively cater to Mumbai’s aspirations."
narendramodi,2019-04-27,"Congress won its lowest seats in 2014 and in 2019, it is contesting the fewest seats in it’s history. The party lacks vision and direction. It’s other Mahamilawat friends are seriously fighting 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 or max 40 seats. How can they provide a stable Government?"
narendramodi,2019-04-27,"Mumbai has overwhelmed me! Yesterday’s rally witnessed a massive turnout. Was especially happy to see many youngsters and women come to bless our alliance. Spoke extensively on NDA’s work and vision for the middle class, economic growth, urban infrastructure and more."
narendramodi,2019-04-26,"On the banks of Ganga in Kashi, spoke to @aajtak and @IndiaToday."
narendramodi,2019-04-26,"This morning, I spoke to @aajtak and @IndiaToday. The interview, which took place on the banks of the Ganga takes you through diverse subjects. Do watch it at 7pm this evening."
narendramodi,2019-04-26,"Happy to be in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh."

narendramodi,2019-04-26,"After programmes in Uttar Pradesh, I’m speaking at a rally in Sidhi, Madhya Pradesh."
narendramodi,2019-04-26,"Before filing my nomination papers, prayed at the temple of Bhagwan Kaal Bhairav, also revered as the Kotwal of Kashi."
narendramodi,2019-04-26,Lively interaction with my young friends! Look at what they’re singing.
narendramodi,2019-04-26,Addressing BJP Karyakartas in Kashi.
narendramodi,2019-04-26,Electrifying atmosphere in Kashi!
narendramodi,2019-04-26,"More than me working for Kashi’s change, Kashi has changed me! Here is how..."
narendramodi,2019-04-25,"On the banks of the Ganga, prayed for India’s peace and prosperity. Glimpses from the magnificent Ganga Aarti in Kashi."
narendramodi,2019-04-25,"Dear sisters and brothers of Kashi, If only words could do justice to the affection I have received from you all. Your blessings give me unparalleled strength to do as much I can for the development of our country!"
narendramodi,2019-04-25,"After bumper rallies in Darbhanga and Banda, I am heading to beloved Kashi. There are a series of programmes lined up, which would give me another excellent opportunity to interact with my sisters and brothers of Kashi. Har Har Mahadev!"
narendramodi,2019-04-25,So many great women and men took part in the freedom struggle. Do we ever ask what caste did they belong to? Do we ever ask what caste did the marchers of Dandi belong to? Let us rise above divisions and work as a team for India’s progress.
narendramodi,2019-04-25,"At the rally in Banda, talked about a series of subjects, particularly NDA’s vision for irrigation and ensuring every household has access to clean water. Also emphasised on the need of a stable Government at the Centre, which can realise the dreams of the people of India."
narendramodi,2019-04-25,Campaigned in Darbhanga in Bihar. Highlighted the work done by the NDA Government at the Centre and the Bihar Government under @NitishKumar Ji. Also spoke about the need to eliminate the menace of terrorism.
narendramodi,2019-04-25,A fruit I enjoy eating...
narendramodi,2019-04-25,"My school days, a dormant bank account and a contribution towards educating daughters of some of the staff in the Gujarat CMO…"
narendramodi,2019-04-24,Memories from Ranaghat…outpouring of support and affection. Thank you West Bengal!
narendramodi,2019-04-24,"Till a few years ago, it was considered impossible for the BJP to hold mega rallies in Bengal but the hardwork of our Karyakartas has changed the situation. Have a look at images of these rallies in Bolpur and Ranaghat. Overwhelming support points to a historic outcome!"
narendramodi,2019-04-24,"Respected Didi, Film stars from other nations and TMC goons will not save your party. West Bengal has decided that it is time to defeat TMC!"
narendramodi,2019-04-24,"India’s stand on terror is respected. Indians stuck in conflict zones coming back home. Indian workers imprisoned in The Gulf coming back. Stolen antiquities returned. Solar Alliance taking shape. Just some achievements of a proactive foreign policy, which Didi questions!"
narendramodi,2019-04-24,"Gurudev Tagore dreamt of a Bengal where the mind is without fear and the head is held high but TMC’s Bengal is different. Infiltrators get easy entry, criminals get a free hand and corruption is rampant. BJP offers a change from the misrule of TMC."
narendramodi,2019-04-24,"The menace of terror needs to be controlled at the earliest and for that, a strong Government is needed."
narendramodi,2019-04-24,Speaking in Ranaghat in West Bengal. Watch. https://pscp.tv/w/b5A8KTMyMjExNTJ8MW1uR2V2QmRnYVFKWE65M88FQm5SI5S0KuGzfklTaeG2EPl_v6_QGMPq9932
narendramodi,2019-04-24,"Didi will again be angry today, seeing the immense support for BJP in West Bengal. Watch from Bolpur."
narendramodi,2019-04-24,Voted in Ahmedabad. Addressed two rallies in Odisha. Went to West Bengal to address a rally. Then reached Ranchi where a massive roadshow was held. Nothing better than being among the people of India! Watch highlights from yesterday.
narendramodi,2019-04-24,"The campaign takes me to parts of Jharkhand and West Bengal. Will speak at a rally in Lohardaga. Will then address rallies in Bolpur and Ranaghat in West Bengal, where BJP is rising and TMC rallies are super flops!"
narendramodi,2019-04-23,Thank you Jharkhand for the affection! Here are glimpses from Ranchi.
narendramodi,2019-04-23,"The life of Bhagwan Birsa Munda epitomises unparalleled courage. His struggles and sacrifice give strength to millions, especially the poor, marginalised and downtrodden. In Ranchi today, I paid tributes to this great son of the soil."
narendramodi,2019-04-23,The Government that New India wants and why BJP is the preferred choice of the youth…
narendramodi,2019-04-23,"Here is the reality of the TMC model of ‘development.’ Warning - it is corrupt, violent and regressive."
narendramodi,2019-04-23,"Here are pictures from the campaign in Kendrapara and Balasore, Odisha. After leaving matters of administration to a coterie of officials, BJD is now bringing a culture of violence to the state. The impending defeat is making BJD desperate but no force will prevent their slide!"
narendramodi,2019-04-23,"Dear @akshaykumar, it was good talking to you about everything, except politics and elections :) I'm sure people would like watching our conversation."
narendramodi,2019-04-23,TMC bullying isn't going to stop BJP! West Bengal has decided to vote BJP...watch from Asansol.
narendramodi,2019-04-23,Second rally of the day in Odisha. Hear my speech in Balasore.
narendramodi,2019-04-23,Kendrapara will not vote for Congress or BJD. It’s BJP everywhere in this seat. Watch.
narendramodi,2019-04-23,"Sharing some more glimpses from Ahmedabad, where I voted."
narendramodi,2019-04-23,Voted! It feels great to be taking part in our democratic process.
narendramodi,2019-04-23,Urging all those voting in today’s Third Phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections to do so in record numbers. Your vote is precious and will shape the direction our nation takes in the years to come. I’ll be voting in Ahmedabad in a short while from now.
narendramodi,2019-04-22,"Campaigned in Jodhpur this evening. The mood was euphoric. Situation of the Congress in Rajasthan is so bad that the Chief Minister has given up on other seats and is going to every small lane of Jodhpur just to protect his own dynasty. But, people are with BJP!"
narendramodi,2019-04-22,"This is how Udaipur came to support us! At today’s huge rally, spoke about the steps taken by the NDA Government for the poor, marginalised and downtrodden. Also exposed Congress’ double speak on strategic affairs and their neglect of the welfare of tribal communities."
narendramodi,2019-04-22,Did anyone imagine that the postman and post offices could be harbingers of dignity and prosperity! Your vote in 2014 made it happen!
narendramodi,2019-04-22,"Dear citizens, Your vote in 2014 gave India a strong Government that could protect the nation. Otherwise, the timid behaviour of Congress-NCP greatly harmed our strategic interests."
narendramodi,2019-04-22,"Sharing glimpses from Dindori and Nandurbar in Maharashtra. For Congress and their Mahamilawat friends, the seats are going lower so their lies and abuses are getting higher. Despite their repeated lies and abuses, NDA will remain the people’s preference."
narendramodi,2019-04-22,Great to catch a glimpse of the Statue of Unity on the way to Rajasthan!
narendramodi,2019-04-22,Whenever Congress comes to power: Prices are high. Taxes are high. Irrigation projects are delayed. National security is ignored. BJP’s development agenda empowers millions. Here are highlights from Rajasthan yesterday.
narendramodi,2019-04-22,"Will be heading to Maharashtra and Rajasthan yet again to seek people’s blessings. Calling upon the people of Dindori, Nandurbar, Udaipur and Jodhpur to join the rallies in large numbers. I shall talk about the BJP’s development agenda."
narendramodi,2019-04-22,"Thank you @shekharkapur. Giving my best for the development of this great country that we all are blessed to be living in. Much has been done and there’s more to do. With people’s blessings, we will turn the impossible into possible!"
narendramodi,2019-04-21,"Chittorgarh is a land of bravery. People have great attachment to the armed forces. But, the way Congress has repeatedly insulted our forces has angered people. People here also feel Congress lacks the vision to solve irrigation-related issues. That is why, they will vote BJP!"
narendramodi,2019-04-21,India will always be grateful to those brave personnel who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty. Their courage inspires millions.
narendramodi,2019-04-21,Today’s campaigns in Rajasthan gave me a glimpse of the anger among people against the Congress misrule. Loans of farmers have not been waived off as promised. Allowances promised to the youth have not been given. People are angry. Here are glimpses from Barmer.
narendramodi,2019-04-21,"An ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh each for the next of kin of those who passed away has been approved from the PM’s National Relief Fund. Rs 50,000 each for the injured has also been approved."
narendramodi,2019-04-21,"Saddened by the loss of lives due to the stampede at a temple in Thuraiyur, Trichy. My condolences to the families of those who passed away and prayers with the injured. All possible help is being extended by the authorities."
narendramodi,2019-04-21,"Real empowerment is incomplete without human dignity. Over the last five years, we have enhanced the dignity of several Indians."
narendramodi,2019-04-21,Coming back to Patan brings back many memories. I have grown up in this great land and this soil has given me blessings I will always cherish.
narendramodi,2019-04-21,"Addressed a massive rally in Patan. Gujarat has decided to give BJP a similar mandate as they did in 2014! Talked about measures taken for better irrigation, farmer welfare and ‘Ease of Living.’"
narendramodi,2019-04-21,Strongly condemn the horrific blasts in Sri Lanka. There is no place for such barbarism in our region. India stands in solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka. My thoughts are with the bereaved families and prayers with the injured.
narendramodi,2019-04-21,Read this insightful interview of BJP President Shri @AmitShah with @IndianExpress
narendramodi,2019-04-21,"Today, we pay tributes to the great Sardar Patel whose outstanding role in the making of our present day civil service ensured our nation has a strong administrative framework that empowers millions of lives through policy interventions and methodical implementation."
narendramodi,2019-04-21,"In West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, people want a Government that works for development and protects our national security. Their choice is BJP. Here are highlights from yesterday’s rallies."
narendramodi,2019-04-21,"Heading westwards today. Will join rallies in Patan (Gujarat), Chittorgarh and Barmer (Rajasthan). Gujarat and Rajasthan have seen the pioneering work of BJP. In Rajasthan, there is a sense of betrayal and despondency after Congress came to power. People will reject Congress."
narendramodi,2019-04-21,Greetings on Easter! The sacred thoughts of Lord Jesus Christ inspire millions. He emphasised on making our society free from evils and being compassionate towards the poor and downtrodden. May this special day enhance the spirit of peace and togetherness.
narendramodi,2019-04-20,"Campaigned in Etah, Uttar Pradesh. I remember coming here during the 2014 campaign as well and that time, the crowds were not even half of the attendance today. This clearly shows the support for BJP’s development agenda has risen in UP!"
narendramodi,2019-04-20,"Dear citizens, Is removing terrorism more important or removing Modi? Is removing poverty more important or removing Modi? Is removing homelessness more important or removing Modi? Why is the Opposition basing their campaign on removing Modi? Intellectual bankruptcy?"
narendramodi,2019-04-20,"Sharing some images from the rally in Aonla. SP, BSP and Congress know that the first two phases have not gone as they desired. People have not got carried away by their lies. Now, they are trying to sharpen their lying game and spread bigger mistruths."
narendramodi,2019-04-20,"The Congress and their Mahamilawat friends have an evil design to deny the rights of reservation to SC, ST and OBC communities and give those rights to their votebanks. But, their designs are unconstitutional and an insult to respected Dr. Babasaheb."
narendramodi,2019-04-20,"These images from West Bengal’s Buniadpur indicate the strong desire for change across the state. Buniadpur, a blessed land associated with Maa Kali and Bhagwan Shiv has been ignored by Congress, Left and TMC. BJP will end the culture of violence and votebank politics."
narendramodi,2019-04-20,"Saddened by the demise of veteran IAS officer and former Chief Secretary of Gujarat, Shri HK Khan. Known for outstanding administrative skills and firm grip on policy matters, Mr. Khan made an indelible contribution to Gujarat’s growth. Condolences to his family and friends."
narendramodi,2019-04-20,"Want to see the direction of the wind this election? Come here to Araria, Bihar... Watch"
narendramodi,2019-04-20,Bullying of TMC won't prevent a massive defeat for that party. Bengal is with BJP. Watch from Buniadpur. Watch
narendramodi,2019-04-20,BJP is not a party that exists merely for winning elections. We are here to serve the people of India and build a nation that our freedom fighters dreamt of.
narendramodi,2019-04-19,"Empowering India, transforming lives. Here is a glimpse of the work we have done in the last five years, every single day."
narendramodi,2019-04-19,Our track record manifests how we have waged a successful war against Inspector Raj. Traders have benefitted due to this.
narendramodi,2019-04-19,"If there is one trait one associates with small businesspersons, it is rigour and hard work. It is this hard work that has played a key role in building India."
narendramodi,2019-04-19,"Had an extensive interaction with trader friends from across India. For decades, Congress gave the nation License Raj, Permit Raj and Quota System in trade & commerce. This destroyed room for innovation and enterprise. Jana Sangh and BJP have always worked for small businesses."
narendramodi,2019-04-19,You will enjoy this interview of mine with @TimesNow. Watch. #PMModiOnTimesNow
narendramodi,2019-04-19,Watch my interview with @TimesNow at 9 this evening. Have shared my thoughts on a wide range of contemporary issues. #PMModiOnTimesNow

narendramodi,2019-04-18,"Dear First Time Voters, This is what makes my resolve of building a New India even stronger!"
narendramodi,2019-04-18,2014 was a mandate for hope and aspiration. 2019 is about confidence and acceleration. Read my interview to @timesofindia.
narendramodi,2019-04-18,The large audience at my rallies across Karnataka are making Congress and JD(S) nervous. On 23rd May they will get a bigger shock when it will be a BJP sweep in the state. Sharing pictures from Bagalkot and Chikkodi.
narendramodi,2019-04-18,"The Honourable Chief Minister of Karnataka says talking about the valour of our armed forces makes his vote-bank unhappy. Mr. Chief Minister, what votebank is this? May I remind Congress-JD(S) that polls are in Bagalkot not Balakot across the borders!"
narendramodi,2019-04-18,"It makes every Indian proud that our nation is home to the world's largest statue. Tourists from all over are coming to the 'Statue of Unity.' But, have you seen any Congress leader visit the 'Statue of Unity' to pay respects to Sardar Patel?"
narendramodi,2019-04-18,"The affection I received from the people of Amreli will remain etched in my memory. At the rally today, highlighted why a vote for NDA is a vote for more opportunities for youngsters, better irrigation for farmers, and next-generation infrastructure."

narendramodi,2019-04-18,Thank you for the affection Amreli! Here is my speech at the rally. Watch

narendramodi,2019-04-17,"It is always a delight to be in Surendranagar. This is a land of bravery and is home to exceptionally talented citizens. During the public meeting, spoke about our efforts to enhance connectivity and infrastructure. Also spoke about steps for the welfare of the middle class."
narendramodi,2019-04-17,"The culture of Governance has changed over the last five years. Corruption and middlemen are history. Not surprisingly, the usual suspects are unhappy. So, they abuse me daily. Their latest rant is clearly anti-OBC."
narendramodi,2019-04-17,Those sitting in AC rooms and predicting poll outcomes should come to Madha. It’s a clear wave for the BJP-Shiv Sena-RPI(A). Even seasoned Opposition leaders are running away from elections as they know the outcome. @BJP4Maharashtra @ShivSena
narendramodi,2019-04-17,"My third rally in Gujarat, this one from Anand. Great vibrancy here. Watch. Watch"
narendramodi,2019-04-17,People of Surendranagar have always blessed BJP. Watch my speech. Watch

narendramodi,2019-04-16,Congress lacked guts to retaliate when a terror attack took place so they invented a bogey of Hindu Terror! A tradition that believes in peace & harmony for thousands of years was targeted to hide a Dynasty’s weakness. People won’t forgive Congress for this.
narendramodi,2019-04-16,"At the grand rally in Bhubaneswar, talked about BJP’s vision for Odisha in agriculture, water resources and infrastructure. BJD is patronising chit fund scamsters, commission seekers, bullies and poor administrators. Such a party has no right to govern Odisha."
narendramodi,2019-04-16,I thank my sisters and brothers of Bhubaneswar who joined the roadshow in large numbers. The enthusiasm is reflective of Odisha’s desire to elect BJP.
narendramodi,2019-04-16,"After a huge roadshow, addressing a massive rally in Bhubaneswar. Watch."
narendramodi,2019-04-16,"Campaigned in Korba and Bhatapara, Chhattisgarh. Ever since Congress came to power in the state, Maoists are getting a free run. Lives of people are in danger. The state Government is also denying benefits of Ayushman Bharat. No wonder there’s anger against Congress."
narendramodi,2019-04-16,Another rally in Chhattisgarh. Watch from Bhatapara. Watch
narendramodi,2019-04-16,Congress has disappointed Chhattisgarh. The state will bless BJP again this time. Watch from Korba.

narendramodi,2019-04-14,"I want to clearly tell JKNC and PDP leaders: Jammu and Kashmir is tired of your self-seeking politics. Kashmir isn’t your inherited Jagir. In J&K, like everywhere else, the voice of the people will reign supreme!"
narendramodi,2019-04-14,"Such is the pressure of The Dynasty that every Congress leader succumbs. Otherwise, what else explains Captain Amarinder Singh Ji, a devout nationalist himself, remaining absent from the official programme observing 100 years of Jallianwala Bagh massacre?"
narendramodi,2019-04-14,Kathua’s mood is clear - BJP is seen as the only party that can bring development and ensure security. People in Jammu are disgusted with Congress' attempts to weaken the armed forces. Nobody here accepts the JKNC demand of India having two Prime Ministers.
narendramodi,2019-04-14,"A grateful nation salutes the architect of our Constitution, a stalwart whose struggles inspire countless youngsters, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. In Delhi, joined a programme to pay tributes to respected Babasaheb."

narendramodi,2019-04-13,Memorable Mangaluru moments...
narendramodi,2019-04-13,Thank you Mangaluru for the love and affection today.
narendramodi,2019-04-13,"When one works with motto of India First, a grand memorial for Dr. Kalam is built in Tamil Nadu. Congress works with Family First, so they even forget great sons of Tamil Nadu like Dr. S. Radhakrishnan and Shri R. Venkataraman. Their only interest is one dynasty."
narendramodi,2019-04-13,The otherwise dishonest Congress mistakenly spoke the truth on one occasion. Hear more...
narendramodi,2019-04-13,"Political climate in Tamil Nadu clearly favours NDA. Have a look at pictures from Theni. DMK-Congress are in big trouble. Their rallies are witnessing very thin attendance which is why they’re trying all sorts of tricks to draw crowds. But, people have decided to reject them."

narendramodi,2019-04-12,"Left, Congress, fake liberals, fake NGOs, fake civil society groups, Urban Naxals and ‘Tukde Tukde gang’ desperately want to make Kerala a laboratory for their mischief. Till BJP is there, they won’t succeed. Their force will never be able to destroy our faith!"
narendramodi,2019-04-12,"At a packed rally in Kozhikode, spoke about NDA’s vision for the nation and for Kerala’s development. Talked about efforts of the Centre to create infrastructure, help farmers and promote tourism. A new political narrative will emerge from Kerala, UDF and LDF will be rejected."
narendramodi,2019-04-12,2019 Lok Sabha polls are a contest between those who believe in Nation First and those dynasts who put their Family First.
narendramodi,2019-04-12,"Congress and JD(S) would not like the sights from Gangavathi… it is BJP all the way! Before every election either Deve Gowda Ji or Kumaraswamy Ji make ‘promises’ to quit politics if BJP wins but they never keep their word. On the contrary, they field more family members!"
narendramodi,2019-04-12,"BJP-Shiv Sena-RPI (A) victory in Ahmednagar will be even bigger this time! There is no expectation from Congress but at least a veteran like Pawar Saheb could have condemned shameful statements by JKNC leaders. Except in the name, there is nothing nationalist about NCP."
narendramodi,2019-04-12,"Today’s campaigns will be in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Kerala. Inviting the people of Ahmednagar, Gangavathi, and Kozhikode to join today’s public meetings. You can also watch live on the NaMo App."

narendramodi,2019-04-11,2019 Lok Sabha elections commence today. I call upon all those whose constituencies are voting in the first phase today to turn out in record numbers and exercise their franchise. I specially urge young and first-time voters to vote in large numbers.
narendramodi,2019-04-10,"The Congress has never cared for the poor and now, the middle class is also on their target. No wonder the Congress wants to increase taxes for the middle class. In contrast, NDA ensured that the burden on the middle class decreases."

narendramodi,2019-04-07,"Communists claim to stand up for the rights of workers. But, their actions in India indicate otherwise. The Left, which had many CMs, MPs, MLAs, arm-twisted Governments in Delhi, is now desperately fighting for survival. Their leaders are seen more on TV than among people!"

narendramodi,2019-04-07,"Saradha, Narada, Rose Valley. These scams are examples of the reign of loot under TMC. Money belonging to the poor is snatched by TMC leaders. Once BJP comes to power in Bengal, such corruption will be history."
narendramodi,2019-04-07,Why are TMC and Didi so disturbed when: India acts strongly against the forces of terror. India strengthens its position as a space superpower. Farmers get income support. Poor people get health insurance. Why is Didi supporting those who want 2 Prime Ministers in India?
narendramodi,2019-04-07,"Speed breaking tactics of Didi and bullying of TMC was not enough to prevent a huge turnout at the Cooch Behar rally. TMC behaviour was so juvenile that they even put parallel structures at the venue. Sadly for them, people still came and blessed us. TMC’s days are numbered!"
narendramodi,2019-04-07,"Be it Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Maharashtra, the work of the Central Government is admired everywhere. Congress’ inability to provide basic healthcare, weak stand on national security, and plan to raise taxes is worrying people. Here are yesterday’s campaign highlights."

narendramodi,2019-04-06,"Overwhelmed by the warm response in Balod, Chhattisgarh. Driven by politics, the Congress Government in the state is denying people the benefits of Ayushman Bharat. People are seeing through such pettiness and are also angry at other unfulfilled promises of Congress."

narendramodi,2019-02-10,"The BJP has served, is serving and always will serve the people of Andhra Pradesh. In the last four and a half years, whatever had to be done to ensure justice for my sisters and brothers of Andhra Pradesh, we have done. We stand with Andhra Pradesh and its great people."
narendramodi,2019-02-10,One must admire Chandrababu Naidu Garu’s honesty. He says he is a wealth creator! He’s obviously creating lots of wealth for him and his son while AP suffers. We are patriotic Indians...we are only thinking about the nation. Creating wealth is never on our minds.
narendramodi,2019-02-10,I thank the TDP cadre and their leader for wishing what every patriotic Indian also wishes- that Modi goes back to Delhi and once again becomes the Prime Minister! I guess they have read the writing on the wall!
narendramodi,2019-02-10,"My ‘senior’ in politics, Shri Chandrababu Naidu obviously has lots to hide. Else why won’t he give an account of what his miserable Government has done for Andhra Pradesh. Centre has left no stone unturned for the state’s progress but the priorities of the TDP are different."
narendramodi,2019-02-10,"From fighting the Dushta Congress under the formidable NTR Garu to becoming a Dost of Congress, the TDP has come a long way. Andhra Pradesh has seen the TDP’s true colours."
narendramodi,2019-02-09,The BJP is committed to preserving the culture and ethos of Assam.
narendramodi,2019-02-09,"When it comes to Bharat Ratnas, those who ruled the nation for 55 years had a fixed approach- the award for some was reserved the moment they were born while others were ignored. Atal Ji’s Government and the present NDA Government honoured two greats from Assam."

narendramodi,2019-02-09,One of the prime considerations behind the impetus towards Arunachal Pradesh’s all-round development is to make the state an even bigger hub for tourism. More people from India and across the world should come to Arunachal! Tourism also boosts the local economy.
narendramodi,2019-02-09,"55 years of one party and 55 months of BJP... in all spheres of Arunachal Pradesh’s development, our work has been quicker and all-inclusive. The Congress ignored the youth of the state and their apathy towards the Jawans guarding our nation is anyway well known."
narendramodi,2019-02-09,"Efforts are on, for not one, but two airports in Arunachal Pradesh! Such focus on connectivity and affordable aviation is unheard of in Arunachal Pradesh’s history!"

narendramodi,2019-02-08,"In TMC rule the following are welcome: Illegal infiltrators. Chit fund looters. Leaders who face corruption charges. But, those believing in democracy are not welcome. What TMC is doing is not the culture of West Bengal. They are trying to destroy the state’s culture."
narendramodi,2019-02-08,"Have you ever seen a sitting CM doing Dharnas to defend those who looted the people in Chit Funds? Well, it happened in West Bengal. It is deeply unfortunate."
narendramodi,2019-02-08,"If we thought the Communists were bad, meet Communism Part 2- the TMC! Didi is CM but someone else’s Dadagiri goes on in West Bengal. Didi is in such a hurry to go to Delhi that she has left the state in the hands of middlemen and a syndicate."
narendramodi,2019-02-08,"North Bengal and I, both have a deep association with tea. But, Didi dislikes both the tea sector and the tea-seller. No wonder she is not working for the development of North Bengal!"
narendramodi,2019-02-08,"Pictures from the public meeting in Raigarh. People of Chhattisgarh are already disappointed with the Congress government in the state. I talked about the steps taken by the Centre for the welfare of the farmers, middle class and unorganised sector."

narendramodi,2019-02-03,Delighted to be in Leh. Addressing a public meeting.
narendramodi,2019-02-02,Eastern India is at the core of our development agenda but projects in West Bengal either do not start on time or their speed is slow. Do you know why? Because TMC refuses to work on any project where their syndicate cannot make money!
narendramodi,2019-02-02,"The people of West Bengal are peace loving but the temperament of the Left and TMC is different. They thrive on violence and intimidation. I want to tell them- the people of the state will not be intimidated. And, the people will show their might by rejecting the TMC!"
narendramodi,2019-02-02,"I bow to the people of Thakurnagar. These pictures indicate the enthusiasm towards BJP. The people of West Bengal are speaking loud and clear- they want Parivartan, they want BJP."

narendramodi,2019-01-27,"Elections will come and go, the nation will remain."
narendramodi,2019-01-27,The Opposition is bankrupt when it comes to a positive agenda for India’s development. Their respect for institutions is minimal. Congress leaders are also going abroad to insult people’s mandates. 130 crore Indians are seeing everything! They will punish such forces.
